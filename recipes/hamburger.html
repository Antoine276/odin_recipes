        </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon liquid smoke flavoring</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>seasoned salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a grill for high heat.</li>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, lightly mix together the ground beef, 
                Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke and garlic powder. Form into 3 
                patties, handling the meat minimally. Brush both sides of each 
                patty with some oil, and season with seasoned salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the patties on the grill grate, and cook for about 5 
                minutes per side, until well done.
